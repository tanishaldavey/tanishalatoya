![](https://media.giphy.com/media/fAnzw6YK33jMwzp5wp/giphy.gif)

I'm a frontend engineer that hopes to become a full stack engineer sometime in the near future. I'm a 1909/1911 cohort graduate of the Turing School of Software & Design in Denver, CO. I'm currently learning some backend concepts like building out my own API. My current goal is to finally build out a personal website that houses all my writings -- yes, I also write!
