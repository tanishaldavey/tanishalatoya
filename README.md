I'm an avid learner who is drawn to all things creative, which is one of the reasons I enjoy software development, and particularly frontend development. I actually enjoy the entire process of software development: idea generating, planning, building, testing, and deployment. This GitHub space serves as space for me to explore my learnings in tech. Feel free to poke around and/or say hello 👋

🛠 Tools I use most often: `JavaScript` `React` `TypeScript` `React Testing Library` `Cypress` `Jest`
